`mcp_dart` is a dual-era Dart and Flutter SDK for MCP clients, servers, and AI
hosts. It implements the complete core client/server wire surface of the locked
MCP 2026-07-28 specification, retains the MCP 2025-11-25 feature set, and
negotiates supported earlier initialization-based specifications.

Here, core means the normative wire requirements assigned to client and server
roles by the pinned final specification. It excludes optional MCP
extensions, host UI behavior, an authorization-server implementation, JSON
Schema external-reference resolution, and custom JSON Schema vocabularies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release is `mcp_dart 2.4.2`. The separately versioned stable CLI remains
> `mcp_dart_cli 0.2.1`, which requires `mcp_dart ^2.4.2`.
> Current source passes every scored requirement in the official alpha.11 MCP
> `2025-11-25` and `2026-07-28` client and server sets, including all 25
> required 2026 authorization scenarios, plus bidirectional published
> TypeScript SDK 2.0.0 and Python SDK 2.1.1 interoperability.

## SDK Tier 1 target

The project is pursuing
[MCP SDK Tier 1](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sdk-tiers). Tier 1
is not yet claimed or assigned. The technical baseline is green; the remaining
official audit, repository-governance, and SDK Working Group steps are tracked
in the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) and
[48-feature coverage inventory](doc/sdk-tier-1-feature-coverage.md).

The public maintenance contract is documented in the
[contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), [security policy](SECURITY.md),
[dependency policy](DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md), and
[versioning policy](VERSIONING.md).

## Requirements

| Package | Minimum Dart SDK |
| --- | --- |
| `mcp_dart 2.4.2` | 3.4 |
| `mcp_dart_cli 0.2.1` | 3.12 |

SDK-only generated projects retain the SDK's Dart 3.4 minimum. CLI projects
use Dart 3.12 because the CLI and its toolchain target that release.

Install Dart from [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

## Installation

### Production channel

Use the latest stable package for production projects:

```bash
dart pub add mcp_dart
```

### Pin the stable SDK release

Pin the stable 2.4 line explicitly when reproducible dependency resolution is
important:

```yaml
dependencies:
  mcp_dart: ^2.4.2
```

The snippets below use the current stable SDK line. Package versions
remain separate from protocol profiles: `McpProtocol.stable` names the SDK's
default compatibility policy.

The SDK and CLI are versioned independently. The stable CLI's `^2.4.2`
constraint accepts SDK versions from 2.4.2 up to, but not including, 3.0.0.

### AI agent skills

`mcp_dart` ships [agent skills](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/package-skills) for
building servers, building clients, and serving or connecting over Streamable
HTTP. Install them into your coding agent's skills directory from your app's
root:

```bash
dart run skills@ get
```

For direct SDK integration, start with the
[getting-started guide](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/blob/main/doc/getting-started.md).
The CLI below is optional and provides scaffolding, inspection, and conformance
commands.

## What the SDK provides

- MCP servers, clients, and host integrations with null-safe Dart APIs.
- Core tools, resources, prompts, completion, elicitation, subscriptions,
  logging, roots, and sampling APIs with behavior selected for the negotiated
  protocol era. MCP 2026-07-28 logging is retained for compatibility but is
  deprecated upstream.
- Stdio, Streamable HTTP, IO stream, and custom transports.
- OAuth client discovery/PKCE hooks, server authentication callbacks, DNS
  rebinding protection, and strict Streamable HTTP validation.
- An experimental Tasks extension implementation, MCP Apps metadata helpers,
  and generic extension negotiation. Extensions are separate from core
  protocol coverage; Tasks is not an official extension or part of the SDK's
  core conformance claim.
- Automated MCP 2025-11-25 and MCP 2026-07-28 conformance, bidirectional
  published TypeScript SDK 2.0.0 interoperability, bidirectional Python SDK
  2.1.1 interoperability, real-browser transport tests, a real Flutter Web
  service integration in Chrome, deterministic widget tests, and an
  independent pinned JSON Schema Test Suite gate.
- `mcp_dart 2.4.2` bounds incoming stdio and IO stream messages to 10 MiB by
  default, with configurable limits for larger messages. See the
  [transport guide](doc/transports.md) before upgrading integrations that
  exchange larger frames.
- Hardened Streamable HTTP access and JSON-RPC error diagnostics, plus the
  deprecated, opt-in legacy HTTP+SSE client with
  same-origin routing and bidirectional interoperability against official
  TypeScript SDK 1.30.0 and Python SDK 2.1.1 peers.

MCP has three roles: a host owns the user experience, a client connects that
host to one server, and a server exposes tools, resources, and prompts. A host
can manage multiple clients and servers.

## Protocol profiles

| Profile | Protocol behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `McpProtocol.stable` | Default dual-era profile: prefer MCP 2026-07-28, then fall back to initialization-based MCP specifications; body-only discovery probes are bounded to 5 seconds |
| `McpProtocol.legacy` | Initialization-era profile: negotiate the MCP 2025-11-25, MCP 2025-06-18, MCP 2025-03-26, MCP 2024-11-05, or MCP 2024-10-07 specification |
| `McpProtocol.require2026` | Require MCP 2026-07-28 and reject legacy initialization |

Use `stableProtocolVersion` or `defaultProtocolVersion` for MCP `2026-07-28`.
`previewProtocolVersion` remains as a deprecated alias for applications built
against a 2.3 prerelease.
`latestInitializationProtocolVersion` remains `2025-11-25` when the default
profile falls back to the legacy lifecycle. For compatibility,
`latestProtocolVersion` and `supportedProtocolVersions` retain their mcp_dart
2.2 initialization-era values; use `allSupportedProtocolVersions` for the
dual-era list.

Select a profile only when you need to constrain negotiation:

```dart
final legacyClient = McpClient(
  const Implementation(name: 'my-client', version: '1.0.0'),
  options: const McpClientOptions(protocol: McpProtocol.legacy),
);

final strict2026Server = McpServer(
  const Implementation(name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0'),
  options: const McpServerOptions(protocol: McpProtocol.require2026),
);
```

See the [MCP 2026-07-28 transition guide](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/blob/main/doc/mcp-2026-07-28.md)
for fallback rules and APIs specific to MCP 2026-07-28, or run the
[strict MCP 2026-07-28 example](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/tree/main/example/mcp_2026_07_28).
Applications upgrading from the stable 2.2 line should also follow the
[2.2 to 2.3 migration guide](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/blob/main/doc/migration-2.2-to-2.3.md).

## Quick start with the CLI

Install the matching stable CLI:

```bash
dart pub global activate mcp_dart_cli 0.2.1
mcp_dart create my_server
cd my_server
mcp_dart inspect
```

The `0.2.1` CLI creates a project with `mcp_dart: ^2.4.2`. The inspector
launches the generated stdio server itself. After leaving the interactive
inspector, you can run a single tool directly:

```bash
mcp_dart inspect --tool add --json-args '{"a": 1, "b": 2}'
```

Useful commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `create` | Scaffold a Dart MCP server using the SDK channel paired with the CLI |
| `serve` | Run a generated server over stdio or HTTP |
| `doctor` | Check project health and connectivity |
| `inspect` | Interactively use a server's capabilities |
| `inspect-server` | Produce a structured report for a live server |
| `inspect-client` | Run a stdio harness that inspects a connecting client |
| `trace` | Proxy and record a real stdio session |
| `conformance` | Run the repository's built-in protocol regression fixtures |

See the [CLI documentation](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/tree/main/packages/mcp_dart_cli)
for command options and scope.

Standalone integration examples may declare newer Dart SDK requirements; check
each example README before running it.

## Authentication

`StreamableHttpClientTransport` supports `OAuthClientProvider` and optional
authorization-code discovery. Servers can use `authenticator` or
`authenticationHandler` and publish protected-resource metadata.

The checked-in OAuth examples store tokens in plaintext files for local
learning. Production applications must use platform secure storage or an
encrypted credential service. See the [OAuth examples](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/tree/main/example/authentication)
and [Streamable HTTP authentication](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/blob/main/doc/transports.md#streamable-http-authentication).

Do not expose example HTTP servers directly to untrusted networks. Production
deployments should use TLS, authenticate requests, and configure the documented
[Host and Origin protections](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/blob/main/doc/transports.md#dns-rebinding-protection).

## Platform support

| Target | Stdio | Streamable HTTP | Legacy HTTP+SSE | IO/custom stream |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dart VM / desktop server | Yes | Client and server | Client and server | Yes |
| Browser / Flutter Web | No process spawning | Client | Client | Yes |
| Flutter mobile | Only app-managed native helpers | Remote client | Remote client | Yes |
| Flutter desktop | Local helper processes | Client and server | Client and server | Yes |

Legacy HTTP+SSE is deprecated under MCP SEP-2596 and is retained only for
explicit compatibility. Use Streamable HTTP for new remote integrations.

See [Flutter host and client recipes](https://github.com/leehack/mcp_dart/blob/main/doc/flutter-recipes.md)
for lifecycle and secure-storage guidance.

## Choosing a Dart MCP package

The Dart team maintains [`dart_mcp`](https://pub.dev/packages/dart_mcp) in
[`dart-lang/ai`](https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/tree/main/pkgs/dart_mcp).
Choose it when you prefer the Dart team's APIs. Choose `mcp_dart` when you need
this SDK's transport, security, compatibility, extension, and inspection
surface. Re-check both packages' current releases before a production decision.
