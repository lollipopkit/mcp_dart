# Transport Options

Guide to choosing and configuring MCP transport layers.

## Overview

Transports handle the communication layer between MCP clients and servers. The SDK provides multiple transport options for different use cases.

## Transport Comparison

| Transport | Use Case | Platforms | Bidirectional | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| **Stdio** | CLI tools, local processes | Dart VM, Flutter desktop | ✅ | Low |
| **Streamable HTTP** | Web services, remote APIs | All | ✅ | Medium |
| **Stream** | In-process, testing | All | ✅ | Low |

## Stdio Transport

### Overview

Standard input/output transport for process-based communication. Best for:

- Command-line tools
- Local services
- Process spawning
- Node.js MCP servers

Stdio frames are newline-delimited JSON-RPC messages. The server reports JSON
syntax failures, invalid envelopes, and invalid MCP parameters with the
corresponding JSON-RPC error, while malformed notifications and responses do
not receive a response. A malformed frame is consumed independently so valid
frames later in the same input chunk are still processed.

Each stdio transport accepts at most 10 MiB before one message delimiter by
default. The transport reports an error and closes when a peer exceeds this
limit. The stdio client immediately stops delivering messages on overflow,
even while waiting for an outgoing write or child-process shutdown. It does
not automatically restart after overflow; a later explicit `start()` begins a
new lifecycle. Set `maxIncomingMessageBytes` when a valid integration needs a
different limit. The limit uses UTF-8 bytes and excludes the newline delimiter.

### Upgrading to 2.4.2

Version 2.4.1 did not bound incoming newline-delimited frames. The 2.4.2 release
closes the connection on oversized input to prevent unbounded memory growth.
If your integration intentionally exchanges larger messages, configure a
finite limit appropriate for its payloads and memory budget on each receiving
transport. For example:

```dart
const maxMessageBytes = 16 * 1024 * 1024;

final clientTransport = StdioClientTransport(
  StdioServerParameters(
    command: 'dart',
    args: ['run', 'server.dart'],
    maxIncomingMessageBytes: maxMessageBytes,
  ),
);
final serverTransport = StdioServerTransport(
  maxIncomingMessageBytes: maxMessageBytes,
);
```

`IOStreamTransport` accepts the same named parameter. Limits apply to incoming
messages independently at each endpoint; increasing one side's limit does not
change its peer's limit. After overflow, correct the peer or limit before an
explicit restart; do not retry an oversized message in an automatic loop.

### Server Setup

Use `StdioServerTransport` when the server is launched as a local child process
or CLI integration. Connect only after registering capabilities, reserve stdout
for newline-delimited MCP frames, and send application diagnostics to stderr.

```dart
import 'package:mcp_dart/mcp_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  final server = McpServer(
    Implementation(
      name: 'stdio-server',
      version: '1.0.0',
    ),
    options: McpServerOptions(
      capabilities: ServerCapabilities(
        tools: ServerCapabilitiesTools(),
      ),
    ),
  );

  // Register capabilities
  server.registerTool(
    'echo',
    inputSchema: JsonSchema.object(
      properties: {'message': JsonSchema.string()},
      required: ['message'],
    ),
    callback: (args, extra) async => CallToolResult(
      content: [TextContent(text: args['message'] as String)],
    ),
  );

  // Connect stdio transport
  final transport = StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);

  // Server now reads from stdin and writes to stdout
}
```

### Client Setup

#### Connect to Dart Server

Use `StdioClientTransport` to start a trusted local Dart entry point and own its
lifecycle. The client launches the configured process, communicates over its
stdin/stdout, and terminates it when the client closes.

```dart
final client = McpClient(
  Implementation(name: 'client', version: '1.0.0'),
);

final transport = StdioClientTransport(
  StdioServerParameters(
    command: 'dart',
    args: ['run', 'server.dart'],
  ),
);

await client.connect(transport);
```

#### Connect to Node.js Server

```dart
final transport = StdioClientTransport(
  StdioServerParameters(
    command: 'node',
    args: ['server.js'],
  ),
);

await client.connect(transport);
```

#### Connect to Python Server

```dart
final transport = StdioClientTransport(
  StdioServerParameters(
    command: 'python',
    args: ['-m', 'my_server'],
  ),
);

await client.connect(transport);
```

### Configuration Options

```dart
final transport = StdioClientTransport(
  StdioServerParameters(
    command: 'node',
    args: ['server.js'],
    maxIncomingMessageBytes: 16 * 1024 * 1024,
    workingDirectory: '/path/to/server',
    environment: {
      'API_KEY': 'secret',
      'DEBUG': 'true',
    },
  ),
);
```

By default, `environment` is merged with the parent process environment. To
withhold host credentials, copy and sanitize `Platform.environment`, pass that
map as `environment`, and set `includeParentEnvironment: false`. Compare
variable names case-insensitively when sanitizing for Windows compatibility.

The default inherited stderr mode is continuously forwarded. With
`ProcessStartMode.normal`, the transport continuously drains child stderr and
exposes it through the optional broadcast `transport.stderr` stream. The stream
stays stable across automatic child restarts. It retains at most 64 KiB emitted
before the first listener attaches; after that first listener, chunks emitted
during gaps with no listeners follow broadcast semantics and are discarded.
Explicit `close()` closes the stream; a later `start()` creates a new stream
lifecycle with an empty pre-listener buffer.

If a legacy server exits while rejecting the initial `server/discover` probe,
the client transport starts a fresh child before falling back to `initialize`.
After a stateless MCP connection is established, it also restarts an
unexpectedly terminated child and replays active `subscriptions/listen`
requests with their original IDs. It validates the replacement server's
acknowledgments before forwarding new subscription events. Equivalent replay
acknowledgments are transparent; changed replacement filters are exposed on
`McpSubscription.acknowledgmentChanges`. Ordinary in-flight requests are not
replayed, so application retry policy remains authoritative. An idle code-zero
exit is treated as a clean server shutdown. Set
`restartOnUnexpectedExit: false` to close on every child exit instead.

Explicit shutdown closes the child's stdin first, waits briefly for a clean
exit, and only then escalates to process termination signals. Initialization-
era MCP sessions are never restarted because their lifecycle state cannot be
restored by replaying individual requests.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Dart VM** | ✅ | Full support |
| **Web** | ❌ | No process spawning in browser |
| **Flutter desktop** | ✅ | Can launch app-managed helper processes |
| **Flutter mobile** | Platform-dependent | Use only with an app-managed native helper; mobile apps cannot assume arbitrary process spawning |

### Best Practices

#### 1. Process Cleanup

```dart
// ✅ Always close client to terminate server process
final client = McpClient(...);
try {
  final transport = StdioClientTransport(StdioServerParameters(...));
  await client.connect(transport);

  // Use client...
} finally {
  await client.close();  // Terminates server process
}
```

#### 2. Error Handling

```dart
try {
  final transport = StdioClientTransport(
    StdioServerParameters(
      command: 'node',
      args: ['server.js'],
    ),
  );
  await client.connect(transport);
} catch (e) {
  print('Failed to start server: $e');
  // Check:
  // - Is 'node' in PATH?
  // - Does 'server.js' exist?
  // - Are permissions correct?
}
```

#### 3. Logging

```dart
// Server logs to stderr (not stdout, which is used for protocol)
void main() async {
  final server = McpServer(...);

  // Use stderr for logging
  stderr.writeln('Server starting...');

  final transport = StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);

  stderr.writeln('Server ready');
}
```

#### 4. Concurrent Requests

`StdioClientTransport` and `StdioServerTransport` serialize concurrent `send()` calls internally, so overlapping requests such as `Future.wait([...client.callTool(...)])` are safe on a single connected transport. Stdio servers should still reserve `stdout` for MCP messages and write logs to `stderr`.

## Streamable HTTP Transport

### Overview

MCP over HTTP, with optional Server-Sent Events responses. Best for:

- Web applications
- Remote services
- Cloud deployments
- Flutter web apps

### High-Level Streamable HTTP Server

For a simplified dual-era setup, use `StreamableMcpServer`. It routes MCP
2026-07-28 requests statelessly and manages sessions when a peer negotiates the
MCP 2025-11-25 initialization flow.

```dart
import 'package:mcp_dart/mcp_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  final server = StreamableMcpServer(
    serverFactory: (connectionId) {
      // Called per stateless MCP 2026-07-28 request or per legacy session.
      return McpServer(
        Implementation(name: 'my-server', version: '1.0.0'),
        options: const McpServerOptions(protocol: McpProtocol.stable),
      );
    },
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 3000,
    path: '/mcp',
    // Optional hardening for remote deployments
    enableDnsRebindingProtection: true,
    allowedHosts: {'localhost'},
    allowedOrigins: {'http://localhost:8080'},
  );

  await server.start();
  print('Server running on http://localhost:3000/mcp');
}
```

The wrapper and each factory-created `McpServer` default to
`McpProtocol.stable`. For a legacy-only or 2026-only deployment, pass the same
`protocol` value to `StreamableMcpServer` and `McpServerOptions`; the wrapper
uses it to route and reject HTTP protocol versions before dispatch.

This helper handles:

- Creating an HTTP server
- Stateless request routing for MCP 2026-07-28
- Sessions, event storage, and resumability for legacy MCP
- Connecting the `McpServer` to the transport

Each MCP 2026-07-28 POST carries exactly one client request or notification.
Clients do not POST JSON-RPC responses or errors in the stateless protocol;
multi-round input uses an `input_required` result instead. Initialization-era
sessions retain client response POSTs for server-initiated requests.

Core MCP 2026-07-28 defines no client-to-server notification over Streamable
HTTP: request cancellation closes that request's response stream. The
transport rejects known server-to-client or removed legacy notification
methods in a client POST, while preserving unknown notification methods for an
extension that defines the required capability and routing headers.

### DNS Rebinding Protection

`StreamableMcpServer` and `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` support DNS rebinding protection, enabled by default for Streamable HTTP entry points.

- Validate `Host` against `allowedHosts`
- Validate `Origin` against `allowedOrigins` (if provided)
- Reject missing/invalid host headers when protection is enabled

Use this for remote/browser-exposed deployments.

#### Deployment recipes

**Safe local development**

Bind only to loopback and allow the exact browser development origin that needs
to call the MCP endpoint:

```dart
final server = StreamableMcpServer(
  serverFactory: (sessionId) => McpServer(
    const Implementation(name: 'local-dev-server', version: '1.0.0'),
  ),
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 3000,
  path: '/mcp',
  enableDnsRebindingProtection: true,
  allowedHosts: {'localhost', '127.0.0.1'},
  allowedOrigins: {'http://localhost:5173'},
);
```

Keep DNS rebinding protection enabled even on localhost. If your browser app runs
on a different dev-server port, add that exact origin instead of using a wildcard.

**Production browser or remote deployment**

Terminate TLS at your reverse proxy or load balancer, expose only the public MCP
hostname, and allow only the trusted web origins that should reach it. If your
deployment needs the Dart process itself to accept HTTPS, provide a custom secure
`HttpServer` setup; `StreamableMcpServer` binds its listener with plain HTTP:

```dart
final server = StreamableMcpServer(
  serverFactory: (sessionId) => McpServer(
    const Implementation(name: 'production-server', version: '1.0.0'),
  ),
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 3000,
  path: '/mcp',
  enableDnsRebindingProtection: true,
  allowedHosts: {'mcp.example.com'},
  allowedOrigins: {'https://app.example.com'},
);
```

For authenticated deployments, pair these transport checks with your OAuth or
bearer-token layer. The examples in `example/authentication/` show the MCP OAuth
flow and PKCE shape; production clients should use PKCE S256 with cryptographic
randomness and keep redirect URIs/origins explicit.

### Streamable HTTP Authentication

Transport allowlists and OAuth solve different problems: validate `Host` and
`Origin` first, then authenticate the accepted request. The helpers below cover
MCP protected-resource discovery and bearer challenges; the examples use
plaintext token files only for local learning. Production applications must use
platform secure storage or an encrypted credential service.

`StreamableMcpServer` can advertise OAuth Protected Resource Metadata and return
the MCP-required bearer challenge when authentication fails:

```dart
final server = StreamableMcpServer(
  serverFactory: (sessionId) => McpServer(
    const Implementation(name: 'protected-server', version: '1.0.0'),
  ),
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 3000,
  path: '/mcp',
  enableDnsRebindingProtection: true,
  allowedHosts: {'mcp.example.com'},
  allowedOrigins: {'https://app.example.com'},
  // Application-defined: verify signature or introspection, issuer, exact
  // resource audience, expiry, and scopes before returning allow.
  authenticationHandler: authenticateRequest,
  oauthProtectedResource: OAuthProtectedResourceOptions(
    metadata: OAuthProtectedResourceMetadata(
      resource: Uri.parse('https://mcp.example.com/mcp'),
      authorizationServers: [Uri.parse('https://auth.example.com')],
      scopesSupported: const ['tools:read'],
    ),
    metadataUri: Uri.parse(
      'https://mcp.example.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp',
    ),
    scope: 'tools:read',
  ),
);
```

`authenticateRequest` is application-defined. See the
[resource-server guide](../example/authentication/OAUTH_SERVER_GUIDE.md) for
the verification boundary. The static-token server in `example/authentication`
is explicitly a local metadata/challenge smoke test, not deployment guidance.

With this option enabled, failed authentication returns `401 Unauthorized` with
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="..."`. Metadata is served at the
endpoint-specific well-known path, such as
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`, and also at the root
`/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` by default. Without
`oauthProtectedResource`, the generic `authenticator` hook keeps its historical
`403 Forbidden` response. Set `metadataUri` to the public metadata URL when a
reverse proxy or TLS terminator rewrites the scheme, host, or port observed by
the Dart server.

Use `authenticationHandler` when authorization needs to distinguish invalid
credentials from insufficient scope:

```dart
authenticationHandler: (request) async {
  final principal = await tokenVerifier.verifyBearerRequest(request);
  if (principal == null) {
    return const StreamableMcpAuthenticationResult.unauthorized();
  }
  if (!principal.scopes.contains('tools:write')) {
    return const StreamableMcpAuthenticationResult.insufficientScope(
      scope: 'tools:write',
      errorDescription: 'Need tools:write',
    );
  }
  return const StreamableMcpAuthenticationResult.allow();
},
```

Here `tokenVerifier` and its verified `principal` are application-defined; do
not derive scopes or identity from an unverified token payload.

With `oauthProtectedResource` configured, `insufficientScope` returns
`403 Forbidden` plus a bearer challenge containing
`error="insufficient_scope"`, `scope="..."`, and `resource_metadata="..."`.
The existing bool `authenticator` callback remains source-compatible for simple
allow/deny checks.

On the client side, `StreamableHttpClientTransport` keeps existing
`OAuthClientProvider` implementations working. Providers that also implement
`OAuthAuthorizationCodeProvider` let the transport perform MCP OAuth discovery:
it parses bearer challenges, fetches OAuth Protected Resource Metadata, falls
back to the endpoint/root well-known protected-resource paths when needed,
discovers OAuth Authorization Server Metadata or OpenID Connect Discovery
metadata, builds a PKCE S256 authorization URL with the MCP `resource`
parameter, and exchanges the authorization code with `code_verifier` and
`resource` when
`finishAuthRedirect(code, state: callbackState, issuer: callbackIssuer)` is
called. Always read the returned `state` from the callback URI and pass it back;
the transport rejects missing or mismatched state before contacting the token
endpoint. If authorization-server metadata advertises the authorization
response `iss` parameter, pass the callback's `iss` value through `issuer:` as
well. The deprecated `finishAuth(code)` method is retained for v2.2.2
compatibility only and assumes the application validated the redirect itself.

OAuth discovery is same-origin by default. Loopback MCP endpoints may discover
other loopback endpoints for local development. For a separate production
authorization host, approve only the expected HTTPS hosts:

```dart
final transport = StreamableHttpClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('https://mcp.example.com/mcp'),
  opts: StreamableHttpClientTransportOptions(
    authProvider: authProvider,
    oauthUriValidator: (uri, endpointKind) =>
        uri.host == 'auth.example.com',
  ),
);
```

Client registration is resolved in this order:

1. Use configured client information when `clientId` is non-empty. An ordinary
   value is treated as a pre-registered client. When the authorization server
   advertises Client ID Metadata Document support, a secretless, conforming
   HTTPS metadata-document URL is treated as CIMD.
2. Use deprecated Dynamic Client Registration only when `clientId` is empty
   and the authorization server publishes a registration endpoint.
3. Fail authorization when neither form is available.

Pre-registered credentials and dynamic registrations are bound to the exact
authorization-server issuer that supplied them. Providers whose secretless
client ID is itself a URL should avoid an ambiguous CIMD-shaped URL unless they
intend the authorization server to treat it as a Client ID Metadata Document.

The transport rejects user information, fragments, non-HTTP(S) URLs, and
non-loopback plaintext HTTP. A client redirect URI must use HTTPS, except that
HTTP is allowed for loopback hosts. OAuth metadata, registration, and token
requests do not follow redirects automatically. The authorization-server
metadata `issuer` must exactly match the raw selected issuer identifier; URI
normalization does not make a different issuer equivalent.

The exchanged value passed to `saveTokens` is an
`OAuthIssuerBoundAuthorizationCodeTokens` instance. Providers should persist
its `authorizationServerIssuer` and `resource` together with the access and
refresh tokens, `tokenType`, `expiresIn`, and granted `scope`. The transport
checks those bindings before reusing the token and unions a persisted granted
scope with scopes from a later `insufficient_scope` challenge. If the token
endpoint omits `scope`, the transport persists the requested scope as the
effective scope. Legacy providers may continue to return a plain `OAuthTokens`
for source compatibility, but that older shape cannot prove issuer/resource
binding after an authorization-server migration. Migrate persisted
authorization-code credentials to the issuer-bound subtype before relying on
that protection.

Authorization server metadata must explicitly advertise
`code_challenge_methods_supported` with `S256`; missing metadata is treated as
no PKCE support and the transport refuses the authorization-code flow.

Executable coverage for these recipes lives in
[`test/server/streamable_security_harness_test.dart`](../test/server/streamable_security_harness_test.dart).
It verifies that local-development and production allowlists reject untrusted
Host/Origin headers before authentication runs, and that authentication still
gates requests after transport-level checks pass. The OAuth client PKCE flow is
covered by
[`test/example/oauth_client_example_test.dart`](../test/example/oauth_client_example_test.dart)
with a local token endpoint, and the client transport discovery path is covered
by [`test/client/streamable_https_test.dart`](../test/client/streamable_https_test.dart).
MCP 2026-07-28 authorization edge cases are covered by
[`test/client/oauth_2026_compliance_test.dart`](../test/client/oauth_2026_compliance_test.dart);
the official alpha.11 client suite passes all 25 authorization scenarios.
The first-class OAuth protected-resource helper is covered by
[`test/server/streamable_mcp_server_test.dart`](../test/server/streamable_mcp_server_test.dart)
and the official TypeScript SDK OAuth interop path in
[`test/interop/ts_client_with_dart_server_test.dart`](../test/interop/ts_client_with_dart_server_test.dart),
including insufficient-scope upscoping from `tools:read` to `tools:write`.

### Streamable HTTP Strict Defaults

By default, Streamable HTTP server transports also enforce:

- Strict `MCP-Protocol-Version` request header validation
- Rejection of JSON-RPC batch POST payloads

These defaults make compatibility failures visible instead of accepting requests
that the Streamable HTTP spec no longer allows. If you need a temporary migration
mode, disable only the specific check that blocks a known legacy client:

`enableJsonResponse` applies to finite request/response exchanges. If a handler
emits a request-scoped notification or legacy server request before its final
response, the transport automatically promotes that response to SSE so no
in-band message is lost.
Stateless MCP 2026-07-28 JSON responses deliberately use `Connection: close` so a client
disconnect remains observable as request cancellation before the response.
`subscriptions/listen` always receives an SSE response so its acknowledgment,
notifications, and final response remain ordered on the request stream.

```dart
final server = StreamableMcpServer(
  serverFactory: (sessionId) => McpServer(
    const Implementation(name: 'server', version: '1.0.0'),
  ),
  // Only if a legacy client still sends older or experimental versions.
  strictProtocolVersionHeaderValidation: false,
  // Keep DNS rebinding protection enabled and explicit.
  enableDnsRebindingProtection: true,
  allowedHosts: {'mcp.example.com'},
  allowedOrigins: {'https://app.example.com'},
);
```

Or with low-level transport options for a legacy client that temporarily still
sends JSON-RPC batch payloads:

```dart
final transport = StreamableHTTPServerTransport(
  options: StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions(
    // Prefer migrating clients to non-batch Streamable HTTP requests.
    rejectBatchJsonRpcPayloads: false,
    enableDnsRebindingProtection: true,
    allowedHosts: {'mcp.example.com'},
    allowedOrigins: {'https://app.example.com'},
  ),
);
```

Avoid disabling `enableDnsRebindingProtection` on browser-exposed or remote
servers. If you must disable it for an internal compatibility test, bind to
loopback/private networking and put the exception behind a short-lived migration
plan. The compatibility-toggle harness keeps Host/Origin protection enabled
while selectively disabling protocol-version or batch rejection checks, so
legacy-client migration does not silently weaken DNS rebinding defenses.

### Server Setup (Streamable HTTP)

```dart
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:mcp_dart/mcp_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  final server = McpServer(
    Implementation(
      name: 'http-server',
      version: '1.0.0',
    ),
    options: McpServerOptions(
      capabilities: ServerCapabilities(
        tools: ServerCapabilitiesTools(),
      ),
    ),
  );

  // Register capabilities
  server.registerTool(
    'example',
    inputSchema: JsonSchema.object(properties: {}),
    callback: (args, extra) async {
      return CallToolResult(content: [TextContent(text: 'ok')]);
    },
  );

  final transport = StreamableHTTPServerTransport(
    options: StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions(
      sessionIdGenerator: () => generateUUID(),
      eventStore: InMemoryEventStore(),
      enableDnsRebindingProtection: true,
      allowedHosts: {'localhost'},
      allowedOrigins: {'http://localhost:5173'},
    ),
  );

  await server.connect(transport);

  // Create HTTP server
  final httpServer = await HttpServer.bind('localhost', 3000);
  print('Server listening on http://localhost:3000/mcp');

  await for (final request in httpServer) {
    if (request.uri.path != '/mcp') {
      request.response
        ..statusCode = HttpStatus.notFound
        ..write('Not Found');
      await request.response.close();
      continue;
    }

    await transport.handleRequest(request);
  }
}
```

### Client Setup

Use `StreamableHttpClientTransport` for remote services, browser clients, and
Flutter applications. Pass the single MCP endpoint, connect before issuing
requests, and close the client when the application no longer needs the
connection.

```dart
final client = McpClient(
  Implementation(name: 'client', version: '1.0.0'),
);

final transport = StreamableHttpClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('http://localhost:3000/mcp'),
);

await client.connect(transport);
```

### MCP 2025-11-25 and Earlier Session Management

The following session and replay controls apply only when the initialization-era
flow is selected. Two default `McpProtocol.stable` peers negotiate MCP
2026-07-28 and therefore do not use protocol sessions, `MCP-Session-Id`,
GET/DELETE session operations, or replay. Select `McpProtocol.legacy`
explicitly when building a session-dependent deployment.

#### Stateful Sessions

```dart
final server = McpServer(
  Implementation(name: 'legacy-server', version: '1.0.0'),
  options: const McpServerOptions(protocol: McpProtocol.legacy),
);

// Enable legacy session persistence.
final transport = StreamableHTTPServerTransport(
  options: StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions(
    sessionIdGenerator: () => generateUUID(),
    eventStore: InMemoryEventStore(), // Enables resumability
  ),
);

await server.connect(transport);
```

```dart
final client = McpClient(
  Implementation(name: 'legacy-client', version: '1.0.0'),
  options: const McpClientOptions(protocol: McpProtocol.legacy),
);

// Resume a legacy session.
final transport = StreamableHttpClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('http://localhost:3000/mcp'),
  opts: const StreamableHttpClientTransportOptions(
    sessionId: 'existing-session-id', // Resume this session
  ),
);

await client.connect(transport);
```

Generated session IDs are sent in the `MCP-Session-Id` response header. Keep
custom `sessionIdGenerator` output non-empty visible ASCII without spaces or
control characters; UUIDs such as `generateUUID()` are a safe default. Invalid
generated IDs are rejected before the header is written.

With an `eventStore`, resumability follows Streamable HTTP SSE event IDs:
custom event IDs must be non-empty visible ASCII without spaces or control
characters because they are written to SSE `id:` fields and later sent in the
`Last-Event-ID` HTTP header. `Last-Event-ID` replays only events from the
owning live transport/session stream, and unknown or foreign event IDs are
rejected instead of replaying unrelated stream history. Concurrent standalone
GET SSE streams are not fan-out subscriptions: each server-originated JSON-RPC
message is routed to one active stream, not broadcast to every open GET stream.
When a server opens an SSE stream and an event store is configured, the SDK
writes an initial SSE frame with an `id` and empty `data` field so reconnecting
clients can resume from a concrete stream event even before JSON-RPC messages
are available.

When using `StreamableHttpClientTransport` through `McpClient.request`, a
stateful `404 Session not found` clears the stale session, starts a fresh
session with a new `initialize` request that omits the stale `MCP-Session-Id`,
and retries the original request once. Direct `Transport.send` callers and
custom transports can opt into the same client recovery path by throwing
`StaleSessionError` when their stateful session is rejected.

#### Legacy Transport Without Session Persistence

For a legacy-profile deployment that intentionally disables session
persistence:

```dart
// Server: Disable session persistence
final transport = StreamableHTTPServerTransport(
  options: StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions(
    sessionIdGenerator: () => null, // Stateless mode
  ),
);
```

### CORS Configuration

```dart
final httpServer = StreamableMcpServer(
  serverFactory: (_) => createServer(),
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 3000,
  allowedHosts: const {'localhost', '127.0.0.1'},
  allowedOrigins: const {'http://localhost:5173'},
);

await httpServer.start();
```

The high-level server validates Host and Origin and handles preflight requests.
Matching `allowedOrigins` receive exact, credentialed CORS responses. Without
an explicit origin allowlist, servers using the default DNS-rebinding protection
grant credentialed CORS only to loopback-to-loopback development requests;
other allowed requests receive wildcard CORS without credentials. If DNS
protection is disabled, loopback requests also require explicit
`allowedOrigins` for credentials. Low-level
`StreamableHTTPServerTransport.handleRequest` callers own their HTTP routing and
CORS headers. Keep explicit `allowedOrigins` for browser clients.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Dart VM** | ✅ | Full HTTP server support |
| **Web** | ✅ | Client only (fetch API) |
| **Flutter web** | ✅ | Client only, using the browser fetch API |
| **Flutter mobile** | ✅ | Client for remote endpoints; secure tokens with platform storage |
| **Flutter desktop** | ✅ | Client and VM-hosted server support |

### Best Practices

#### 1. Request Headers

```dart
final transport = StreamableHttpClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('http://localhost:3000/mcp'),
  opts: const StreamableHttpClientTransportOptions(
    requestInit: <String, dynamic>{
      'headers': <String, dynamic>{'X-Client-Name': 'mcp-dart-example'},
    },
  ),
);
```

#### 2. Reconnection Configuration

```dart
final transport = StreamableHttpClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('http://localhost:3000/mcp'),
  opts: const StreamableHttpClientTransportOptions(
    reconnectionOptions: const StreamableHttpReconnectionOptions(
      maxReconnectionDelay: 30000,
      initialReconnectionDelay: 1000,
      reconnectionDelayGrowFactor: 1.5,
      maxRetries: 3,
    ),
  ),
);
```

#### 3. Error Recovery

```dart
Future<McpClient> connectWithRetry(
  McpClient Function() createClient,
  Transport Function() createTransport,
) async {
  const maxAttempts = 3;

  for (var attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    final client = createClient();
    try {
      await client.connect(createTransport());
      return client;
    } catch (_) {
      await client.close();
      if (attempt == maxAttempts) rethrow;
      await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2));
    }
  }

  throw StateError('Unreachable');
}
```

#### 4. Health Checks

```dart
final mcpServer = StreamableMcpServer(
  serverFactory: (_) => createServer(),
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 3000,
);
await mcpServer.start();

// Keep health checks separate from the MCP listener, or terminate them at a
// reverse proxy. Do not create and connect a new MCP transport per request.
final healthServer = await HttpServer.bind('127.0.0.1', 3001);
healthServer.listen((request) async {
  if (request.uri.path == '/health' && request.method == 'GET') {
    request.response
      ..statusCode = 200
      ..write('OK');
  } else {
    request.response.statusCode = 404;
  }
  await request.response.close();
});
```

## Stream Transport

### Overview

In-process stream-based communication. Best for:

- Unit testing
- In-process communication
- Isolate communication
- Mock servers

`IOStreamTransport` uses the same 10 MiB incoming message limit. Set
`maxIncomingMessageBytes` on each endpoint when the application needs another
limit.

### Setup

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:mcp_dart/mcp_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  // Create bidirectional streams
  final serverToClient = StreamController<List<int>>();
  final clientToServer = StreamController<List<int>>();

  // Server setup
  final server = McpServer(
    Implementation(name: 'server', version: '1.0.0'),
  );
  server.registerTool(
    'echo',
    inputSchema: JsonSchema.object(
      properties: {'message': JsonSchema.string()},
      required: ['message'],
    ),
    callback: (args, extra) async => CallToolResult(
      content: [TextContent(text: args['message'] as String)],
    ),
  );

  final serverTransport = IOStreamTransport(
    stream: clientToServer.stream,
    sink: serverToClient.sink,
  );
  await server.connect(serverTransport);

  // Client setup
  final client = McpClient(
    Implementation(name: 'client', version: '1.0.0'),
  );

  final clientTransport = IOStreamTransport(
    stream: serverToClient.stream,
    sink: clientToServer.sink,
  );
  await client.connect(clientTransport);

  // Use client and server
  final result = await client.callTool(
    CallToolRequest(
      name: 'echo',
      arguments: {'message': 'hello'},
    ),
  );
  print((result.content.first as TextContent).text);

  // Cleanup
  await client.close();
  await server.close();
  await serverToClient.close();
  await clientToServer.close();
}
```

### Testing Example

```dart
import 'package:test/test.dart';

void main() {
  test('tool execution', () async {
    // Setup streams
    final s2c = StreamController<List<int>>();
    final c2s = StreamController<List<int>>();

    // Create server
    final server = McpServer(
      Implementation(name: 'test-server', version: '1.0.0'),
    );

    server.registerTool(
      'add',
      description: 'Add numbers',
      inputSchema: JsonSchema.object(
        properties: {
          'a': JsonSchema.number(),
          'b': JsonSchema.number(),
        },
      ),
      callback: (args, extra) async {
        final result = (args['a'] as num) + (args['b'] as num);
        return CallToolResult(
          content: [TextContent(text: '$result')],
        );
      },
    );

    await server.connect(IOStreamTransport(
      stream: c2s.stream,
      sink: s2c.sink,
    ));

    // Create client
    final client = McpClient(
      Implementation(name: 'test-client', version: '1.0.0'),
    );

    await client.connect(IOStreamTransport(
      stream: s2c.stream,
      sink: c2s.sink,
    ));

    // Test
    final result = await client.callTool(
      CallToolRequest(
        name: 'add',
        arguments: {'a': 5, 'b': 3},
      ),
    );

    expect(
      result.content.first,
      isA<TextContent>().having((content) => content.text, 'text', '8'),
    );

    // Cleanup
    await client.close();
    await server.close();
    await s2c.close();
    await c2s.close();
  });
}
```

### Platform Support

| Platform | Supported | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Dart VM** | ✅ | Full support |
| **Web** | ✅ | Full support |
| **Flutter** | ✅ | All platforms |

## Legacy SSE Transport (Deprecated)

The SDK retains client and server implementations of the original HTTP+SSE
transport for compatibility with servers that have not migrated to Streamable
HTTP. Do not select it for a new deployment.

HTTP+SSE is Deprecated under
[SEP-2596](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/seps/2596-spec-feature-lifecycle-and-deprecation)
with an earliest removal-eligibility date of 2026-08-18. Eligibility is not
automatic removal: the MCP Core Maintainers still make that decision during
release preparation. The Dart APIs are marked `@Deprecated` and emit one
warning per transport type through the configurable MCP runtime logger.

### Legacy Client Setup

The client opens the configured URL with `Accept: text/event-stream`, waits for
the first dispatched SSE event to be `endpoint`, and then sends each JSON-RPC
message as a separate JSON `POST` to the advertised URL. Relative endpoint URLs
are resolved against the SSE URL. Absolute endpoints are accepted only when
their scheme, host, and effective port match the SSE connection; credentials
and URL fragments are rejected. The opening `GET` and every message `POST`
also reject HTTP redirects rather than forwarding configured headers or MCP
messages to another URL.

```dart
final transport = SseClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('http://127.0.0.1:3000/sse'),
  opts: const SseClientTransportOptions(
    // Applied to both GET and POST. Use secure token storage in production.
    headers: {'Authorization': 'Bearer legacy-token'},
  ),
);
final client = McpClient(
  const Implementation(name: 'legacy-client', version: '1.0.0'),
  options: const McpClientOptions(protocol: McpProtocol.legacy),
);

await client.connect(transport);
final tools = await client.listTools();
```

The transport supports static custom headers. It intentionally does not
duplicate the Streamable HTTP OAuth discovery and authorization-code system.
Use `StreamableHttpClientTransport` for OAuth-managed deployments.

An unexpected end to the SSE stream closes the transport. Legacy HTTP+SSE has
no dependable MCP replay contract, so the client does not replay POSTs or
silently create a replacement session. Reconnect at the application level by
creating a new client and repeating initialization.

### Legacy Server Setup

`SseServerManager` routes the SSE `GET` and message `POST` endpoints for the
existing server transport:

```dart
final manager = SseServerManager(
  mcpServer,
  enableDnsRebindingProtection: true,
  allowedHosts: {'127.0.0.1', 'localhost'},
  allowedOrigins: {'https://trusted-app.example'},
);
await manager.handleRequest(request);
```

Validate any present `Origin`, allow only intended hosts, bind loopback-only
for local servers, and authenticate both endpoints. The compatibility default
for DNS-rebinding protection remains `false`, so production code must enable
it explicitly.

### Why Deprecated?

- Streamable HTTP replaced the two-endpoint design with one MCP endpoint.
- Legacy sessions have no dependable resumption or replay contract.
- The legacy transport does not provide the modern OAuth integration.
- Streamable HTTP is the active transport for new clients and servers.

### Migration Guide

```dart
// Old client (deprecated)
final oldClientTransport = SseClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('https://mcp.example.com/sse'),
);

// Old server (deprecated)
final manager = SseServerManager(mcpServer);
await manager.handleRequest(request);

// New client (recommended)
final clientTransport = StreamableHttpClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('https://mcp.example.com/mcp'),
);

// New server (recommended)
final serverTransport = StreamableHTTPServerTransport(
  options: StreamableHTTPServerTransportOptions(
    sessionIdGenerator: () => generateUUID(),
    eventStore: InMemoryEventStore(),
    enableDnsRebindingProtection: true,
    allowedHosts: {'localhost'},
    allowedOrigins: {'http://localhost:5173'},
  ),
);

await mcpServer.connect(serverTransport);
await serverTransport.handleRequest(request);
```

When an application accepts a URL whose transport is unknown, follow the
official modern-first compatibility sequence: try the Streamable HTTP
initialize POST first and consider legacy SSE only after HTTP 400, 404, or 405.
Keep that policy in application code; `SseClientTransport` never silently
downgrades a modern connection.

## Choosing a Transport

### Decision Matrix

| Requirement | Best Transport |
|-------------|---------------|
| Local CLI tool | **Stdio** |
| Web application | **Streamable HTTP** |
| Remote API | **Streamable HTTP** |
| Unit testing | **Stream** |
| In-process | **Stream** |
| Node.js server | **Stdio** |
| Cloud deployment | **Streamable HTTP** |
| Mobile app (local helper) | **App-managed native helper or custom transport** |
| Mobile app (remote) | **Streamable HTTP** |

### Performance Comparison

| Transport | Latency | Throughput | Resource Usage |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Stream** | Lowest | Highest | Lowest |
| **Stdio** | Low | High | Low |
| **Streamable HTTP** | Medium | Medium | Medium |

### Security Considerations

| Transport | Security Features |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Stdio** | Process isolation, local only |
| **Streamable HTTP** | CORS, authentication, DNS rebinding protection by default; TLS through an HTTPS endpoint or reverse proxy |
| **Stream** | In-process only |

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Transport

Implement your own transport:

```dart
class CustomTransport extends Transport {
  @override
  Future<void> start() async {
    // Initialize transport
  }

  @override
  Future<void> send(
    JsonRpcMessage message, {
    int? relatedRequestId,
  }) async {
    // Send message. Existing transports can keep the int? relatedRequestId
    // signature for source compatibility.
  }

  @override
  Future<void> close() async {
    // Clean up resources
  }

  @override
  String? get sessionId => null;

  // Call this when receiving messages
  void receiveMessage(JsonRpcMessage message) {
    onmessage?.call(message);
  }

  // Call this on connection close
  void handleClose() {
    onclose?.call();
  }

  // Call this on errors
  void handleError(Error error) {
    onerror?.call(error);
  }
}
```

### Request ID-aware Transports

If a custom transport routes messages by JSON-RPC request ID or stream
correlation key, implement `RequestIdAwareTransport` in addition to `Transport`
so string request IDs are preserved:

```dart
class StreamRoutingTransport extends CustomTransport
    implements RequestIdAwareTransport {
  @override
  Future<void> sendWithRequestId(
    JsonRpcMessage message, {
    RequestId? relatedRequestId,
  }) async {
    // Route with the full JSON-RPC request ID shape: String or int.
  }
}
```

Server transports that multiplex independent HTTP exchanges on one transport
instance should also implement `IncomingRequestContextAwareTransport`. Its
opaque context keeps responses and request-scoped notifications isolated when
different clients concurrently reuse the same JSON-RPC request ID. Implement
`RequestContextSseStreamControlAwareTransport` as well when handlers can detach
and resume individual request SSE streams.

### Transport Middleware

Add logging, metrics, or filtering. Log only envelope metadata by default: raw
MCP messages can contain credentials, tool arguments/results, prompt content,
or resource data.

```dart
String describeMessage(JsonRpcMessage message) => switch (message) {
  JsonRpcRequest(:final method, :final id) => 'request method=$method id=$id',
  JsonRpcNotification(:final method) => 'notification method=$method',
  JsonRpcResponse(:final id) => 'response id=$id',
  JsonRpcError(:final id) => 'error id=$id',
};

class LoggingTransport extends Transport implements RequestIdAwareTransport {
  final Transport inner;
  final Logger logger;

  LoggingTransport(this.inner, this.logger);

  @override
  Future<void> start() async {
    logger.info('Starting transport');
    inner.onmessage = (message) {
      logger.debug('Received ${describeMessage(message)}');
      onmessage?.call(message);
    };

    inner.onerror = (error) {
      logger.warn('Error: $error');
      onerror?.call(error);
    };

    inner.onclose = () {
      logger.info('Closed');
      onclose?.call();
    };

    await inner.start();
  }

  @override
  Future<void> send(
    JsonRpcMessage message, {
    int? relatedRequestId,
  }) async {
    logger.debug('Sending ${describeMessage(message)}');
    await inner.send(message, relatedRequestId: relatedRequestId);
  }

  @override
  Future<void> sendWithRequestId(
    JsonRpcMessage message, {
    RequestId? relatedRequestId,
  }) async {
    logger.debug('Sending ${describeMessage(message)}');
    await inner.sendPreservingRequestId(
      message,
      relatedRequestId: relatedRequestId,
    );
  }

  @override
  Future<void> close() async {
    logger.info('Closing transport');
    await inner.close();
  }

  @override
  String? get sessionId => inner.sessionId;
}

// Usage
final transport = LoggingTransport(
  StdioClientTransport(
    StdioServerParameters(
      command: 'node',
      args: ['server.js'],
    ),
  ),
  Logger('Transport'),
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Stdio Issues

**Problem**: Process not starting

```dart
// Check command exists
try {
  final result = await Process.run('node', ['--version']);
  print('Node version: ${result.stdout}');
} catch (e) {
  print('Node not found in PATH');
}
```

**Problem**: Server not responding

```dart
// Enable debug logging
final transport = StdioClientTransport(
  StdioServerParameters(
    command: 'node',
    args: ['server.js'],
    environment: {'DEBUG': 'mcp:*'},
  ),
);
```

### HTTP Issues

**Problem**: CORS errors

```dart
final server = StreamableMcpServer(
  serverFactory: (sessionId) => createServer(),
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  allowedHosts: {'mcp.example.com'},
  allowedOrigins: {'https://app.example.com'},
);
```

Use exact origins for credentialed MCP traffic. Do not work around CORS with a
wildcard; align the browser origin, reverse proxy, and server allowlists.

**Problem**: SSE reconnects give up too quickly

```dart
// Increase retry attempts and maximum backoff
final transport = StreamableHttpClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('http://localhost:3000/mcp'),
  opts: const StreamableHttpClientTransportOptions(
    reconnectionOptions: const StreamableHttpReconnectionOptions(
      maxReconnectionDelay: 60000,
      initialReconnectionDelay: 1000,
      reconnectionDelayGrowFactor: 1.5,
      maxRetries: 5,
    ),
  ),
);
```

**Problem**: MCP 2025-11-25/legacy session not resuming

```dart
final client = McpClient(
  Implementation(name: 'legacy-client', version: '1.0.0'),
  options: const McpClientOptions(protocol: McpProtocol.legacy),
);

final transport = StreamableHttpClientTransport(
  Uri.parse('http://localhost:3000/mcp'),
  opts: StreamableHttpClientTransportOptions(
    sessionId: previousSessionId,
  ),
);

await client.connect(transport);
```
